# Feature file for Eadui font. Copyright (c) 2015 by Peter S. Baker
#

# Ligatures with vowels and alternate vowel shapes are common in this font, causing
# problems with diacritics. Font handles it this way:
#
# 1. Decompose precomposed characters into vowel + combining diacritic
# 2. Let GSUB do its thing
# 3. Position diacritic over alt vowel or ligature element with GPOS/mark
#
# This does not work well with Word, and InDesign defeats the scheme by
# recomposing vowel+combining diacritic combinations into precomposed characters.
#
# However, Harfbuzz handles it well, so it works in the most popular browsers.
#
